<div class="titulo6"> <h3>Apocalypse in Xàtiva</h3> <p><img class="foto13" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mVpVm7wnAsa43H8W7OqjpfEJMh-j1uRx" align="right">In 1707, the city of Xàtiva, a beautiful small city with an awesome castle and an old quarter, was burned down following the order of the damned Philip V (Felipe V) only because the people from Xàtiva supported the Habsburg Clairmont archduke Charles in the battle of succession. Many innocent people died and among them our parents. This king was very annoyed with the inhabitants from Xàtiva. Aréusa and I were playing in the street and we heard a woman shouting “Fire, fire, fire”</p> <p> We went home running, but it was too late: the fired had spread very quickly. My parents could not leave.</p> <p>They told us to leave and said that they loved us. From that moment we haven’t seen them again. We felt lonely. After having escaped, a family sheltered us, and we walked along the Way of St. James on our own trying to look for a new place where we could live and try to forget this great tragedy. It was a long journey. Will we survive? </p> </div><span class="page-number">15</span>

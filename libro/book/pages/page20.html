<div class="titulo6"> <h3>A German Horror Story</h3> <p>It was on the 29th of February 2018 and we were enthusiastically waiting for the German students in Vallada to come to our house.</p> <p>We had planned to go to the celebration of “Mig any de Moros i Cristians“ in Dénia. In this festival, people dress up like their ancestors who lived in Spain, as moorish or as christians, and they make parades. Suddenly, the German student called us and asked for help because he had got lost.<br>The German student said: “I am standing now at the train station and no one is here. The problem is, that I do not know the way to your house. But suddenly it began to rain and we said that we will take the car to pick him up. I got out on my car and said: “Hi, my name is Pedro and my friend Carlos is waiting in the car.“</p> <p>“You’re very kind to pick me up, my name is Kevin and is it possible to go fast to your house because I’ve been standing here for 20 minutes and I am feeling cold?”</p> <p>I agreed and we went in the car. Ten minutes later we were at home. Kevin was so tired that he wanted to sleep directly. </p> <p>Saturday morning, we had breakfast and Carlos had an idea. ”Kevin, what do you think about the Saint James way?” "We talked about it in school, it sounds interesting.”</p></div><span class="page-number">20</span>

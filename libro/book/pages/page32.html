<div class="titulo6"> <p>Even though I know I am going to die, I like the spirit of the Saint James Way and the feeling of finding myself. It helped me to love my current life, because at the end of the day, I can’t change my destiny anyway.</p> <p>Today is the longest stage of the whole St. James Way and I am already very tired. Until the sun sets, we have to reach Algemesí. Phillip is in a better shape than I am, but I'm trying to keep up with him as well as I can. After a short break in the shadow of an orange tree, we get up to face the biggest challenge of this stage: We have to cross a river without any bridge. Depending on the weather it can be very dangerous. The sun shines though, and it looks like we're going to be fine. I pick up my heavy backpack and strap the belts tightly.</p> <p><img class="foto24" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=16KB6HZkoBZ44xauzCwRI7Zb_lSM21P6I" align="right" alt="">After one hour of walking in the burning sun, we finally reach the river. after I have put off my shoes, I slip my feet into the cold water and take a deep breath. A sigh of relief leaves my mouth. I put on my shoes again because the stones in the river could hurt my feet. </p>I lift the backpack over my head and take the first careful step. Step by step I move into the cold water. After ten minutes, we reach the other side soaking wet and cold, but with a huge smile on our faces: We did it! I give Phillip a high five and we decide to keep on walking in our wet clothes because it's such a hot day.</p> </div><span class="page-number">32</span>

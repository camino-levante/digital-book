<div class="titulo6"> <p>Maria arrived in Silla on the day of Christ, the most important holiday of the town which is celebrated in September. There she met a kind old man who invited her to an artichoke as it was the tradition after the procession. They went to a cafe later that day. “Well, what are you doing here lady?” - “Well, you see, I am on my way to visit towers on the pilgrims’ route. And until now, it was worth it!” </p> <p>After Silla she continued towards Almussafes. In the older days, it was just an Arab quarter, consisting of farmhouses and a tower. Maria visited that tower, Racef Tower, located within the town wall.<br>This tower is 13 metres wide in its base and 13.75 metres tall. It was built in the Muslim era to defend the city of Valencia together with the other towers in Silla and Benifaió. This building has been a prison and communal barn. It currently hosts an archaelogical collection and also has a municipal exhibition hall.</p> <p>At the tower she met a lady laying down a carpet and kneeling in front of the tower.<br>Maria asked what she was doing, but she didn’t answer, but instead began to speak Arabic words.<br>It sounded like the lady was praying. </p></div><span class="page-number">54</span>

    <h3>The Amazing Way</h3>
    <p>Maria, a 46-year–old woman, began a fascinating hiking trip on the pilgrims’ route through the towns of Valencia, an old roman city located in Spain.</p>
    <p>She decided to take a trip on the pilgrims’ route because she always wanted to take a long walk.<br> At the age of 32, she had had a severe car accident and had broken both of her legs. After Maria had been operated on, she had needed to walk on crutches. Her right leg had not completely healed because some veins had been squeezed and burst by the accident. Finally, after 13 years, both of her legs had completely recovered and she could walk properly again. After her birthday in August, she planned a trip on the pilgrims’ route and wanted to show many people, that giving up is never an option.

    <p>Before she started the journey, Maria needed to get equipped. She took hiking pants, hiking shoes, sunglasses, a broad-rimmed hat and a bandana with her and started  the trip. She arrived in Silia after a long train ride, a municipality with a population of 19000 people and the first town from which the road would begin.</p>

It’s an ancient dance which consists of Pantomimic dancing (that means dancing in synchrony).

They were used as storehouses, prisons, and even pigeon houses. The interiors are covered with vaults built with cane sticks and mud. </p> <p>Maria felt grateful that she visited the Valencian towns. She learned a lot about the culture of this area and recommends everyone interested in religion or culture to take on this journey as well!</p> </div><span class="page-number">56</span>

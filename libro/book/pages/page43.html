<div class="titulo6"> <h3>Our Journey</h3> <p>On 19th of August last year, we went to Xàtiva’s fair with a German student. His name was Frederik. At first, he was a little antisocial, but as we got to know each other better, he became an energetic and very friendly person. He always wore sunglasses, a bandana and a green rucksack.</p> <p>We set off from Valencia, a very beautiful city with many places to visit, and our journey began.<br>We walked for two days and experienced many adventures. On the first day we met another group with boys and girls that our age. They were very nice and became our friends except for one guy whose name was Carlos: he was unfriendly and not communicative. He did not greet us. But that was not the only thing he did. He offended one girl, Sofia, and bullied her for her looks. Sofia cried the whole evening and was very upset. None of her friends was there to help her because they spent the evening with their new friends, the other group. The next morning Sofia’s bed was empty and she couldn’t be found. Carlos was worried: ”It is my fault! If I hadn’t bullied her yesterday she would still be here. It is my mistake! I feel so bad.” They searched for hours and couldn’t find her. Suddenly they heard a scream. It was Sofia! She stumbled and saw a snake, an adder, approaching. She was in fear because she knew that this type of snake was poisonous. But in the last second a man appeared and saved her. She looked up and saw a guy. It was Carlos! ”You saved me. The snake would have bitten me.”</p> </div><span class="page-number">43</span>

<div class="titulo6"> <p>The next day, it started to rain . But we enjoyed that because it was a welcome cooling for the hot summer weather. That’s why we immediately continued walking our route after a quick but lovely breakfast.<br> It felt nice to be in company at this part of the journey. “Hey, can I ask you something?” “Sure, ask me everything you want to.”, he told me. “What was your motivation to go on a pilgrim journey such as this one?”, I asked. His response surprised me: “Well you know, sometimes life doesn’t go as planned and you might lose yourself which leads to start making decisions you don’t want to make. I lost myself and I simply want to gain my old self back.”</p> <p>“That was deep...”, I said. He laughed. It was a deep heartwarming laugh and I immediately got in. Then I looked into his eyes and said: “I think you can’t get your old self back. No one is the person they were yesterday and they’ll never be again. We’re constantly moving and changing, every single second made us who we are right now, and we decide, who we are becoming tomorrow.” </p> <p>Silence</p> <p>He obviously thought about it, but I was unsure if it was good or bad.b<br>“You’re right.”, he finally answered. “Thank you for telling me that, that was exactly what I needed to hear.” I smiled. “You’re welcome.”<br>After we had been walking for a while, the landscape changed. The path got smaller and we were surrounded by a meadow. It stopped raining and the sun came out. It looked beautiful, smelled like flowers and you could hear insects flying around. From time to time we saw little, lonely houses. ‘Such a peaceful place to live’, I thought.</p></div><span class="page-number">10</span>

<div class="titulo6"> <p>After we have walked five kilometers, I stop. I have to take my medicine. I search for it in my backpack, but for any reason I can't find it. That's impossible! Slowly starting to panic, I begin to take everything out of my backpack. I need that medicine! Without it there isn't any chance I'll even survive the time of this trip. Without that medicine I am a dead man walking! Sweat runs down my face and my heartrate fastens. The medicine isn't in my backpack, I have to face it: I lost the medicine my life depends on, and I have no idea where. Going back could mean I won't reach Algemesí on time, but not going back is a dead sentence anyway. But I can't put Philip in danger with me</p> <p>I convince him to go ahead. "I'll see you in Algemesí!", I say, unsure if that's the truth.</p> </div><span class="page-number">33</span>

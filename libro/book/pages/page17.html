<div class="titulo6"> <p>Near the city of Xàtiva, on the fringe of the wood, there was an abandoned house. It smelled like rotting wood. But this was the first place where we could stay for a few days. First, we were protected here.</p> <p>We could look for wood for the chimney in the forest and eat wild berries. We knew that this was not the best solution but at this moment it was the best of all. After one week a monk knocked at the door. He said that the whole city was burned down. All people died. We were inconsolable. </p> <p>After this terrible message the monk offered to come with us to the monastery. We agreed but we were afraid for all we had experienced although we didn't think so because we wanted to leave this house in the wood. On the way to the monastery we saw two frail figures. “Wait”, Aréusa said. Let us take them with us. “No, we are too much”, “We cannot take them all” the monk said. ‘But we know them’, Aréusa answered. ‘They are our aunt and uncle.’ “Oh I see”. “Please take them with us” “Alright, but only these two” the monk agreed. </p> <p>So they all lived a long time happily and contently at the monastery.</p> </div><span class="page-number">17</span>

But it is not just any ordinary day in Algemesí, it is „la Mare de Déu de la Salut“, which is a festival that has taken place every year since 1247. Since it is their first time visiting the city, they are incredibly excited about the parades, costumes and dances. </p>Along their way departing from Benifaió in the early morning they meet a lot of other excited pilgrims and visitors who don’t want to miss the traditional event either. On their way to the city, they pass a lot of orange trees and farmers cultivating them. When entering the city in the early afternoon, they can already see masses of dressed up people taking part in a colorful parade. They get carried away by people singing and dancing in the streets of Algemesí. <p></p> <p>Wherever you look around you see people dancing traditional Valencian dances such as „Moixaranga“, a street dance to drums and flutes or „Els Tornejants“</p> </div><span class="page-number">47</span>

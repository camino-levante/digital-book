<div class="titulo6"> <h3>Last Way </h3> <p>I feel the sun on my skin, the sweat on my cheeks and the pain in my feet. I have walked all this long way, but I feel good, I feel free. It was a hard decision, but I don’t regret it at all.</p> <p>I’m Michael, 30 years old and I have a reason why I am here. Yesterday I arrived in Benifaió and today I'm hiking to reach Algemesi. Today it’s very hot, the sun is burning on my skin and I am really thirsty. I hope there is going to be a restaurant soon, because I am starving for “rice with a crust“. </p> <p>I am in love with the beauty of the landscape, the flowers smell like honey, the birds are chirping and everywhere I go, there are orange trees. I pick a fruit up and put it in my backpack. I’m alone, alone with my thoughts. My secret will always be a part of me until I die because of it. And that is the reason why I am walking this trail: I want to have one last adventure, before my life gets ruined by my secret, the cancer. I always wanted to walk the Saint James Way and now it is the right time.<br>“Mike, are you coming?” asks my friend Phillip and interrupts my thoughts. “Yes!” I answer.<br>The first time I met Phillip was in the hospital because we shared a room. Phillip helped me to fulfill my dream: To walk the Saint James way. Even though I told him that I didn’t have enough time, he motivated me to reach my goal. He said that memories are more important than money and work. Phillip really convinced me and only a month later, we drove to Valencia and started walking.<br>“Mike, is everything okay with you? Why are you so slow?!” Phillip wakes me up from my daydream. “No, No! I was just thinking a bit about my time in the hospital”</p> </div><span class="page-number">30</span>

<div class="titulo6"><h3><strong>Friendly encounter</strong></h3><p>One pretty hot summer, I was walking on the Saint James way. When I was already in Algemesí, I came across a fellow German pilgrim who was walking the same route as me. "Hi! Can you help me, please?” I asked after I found a blister on my right ankle,”I really need a band-aid" "Probably, give me a second, I will search one." He answered friendly. "Oh, I only have one left, but you can have it!" I took it and put it on my foot" We decided to go together till the next stop.</p><p>Heinz had black hair, wore olive green pants, a red cap and black shoes made for hiking. He was an attractive young man with a good style though. I asked him if he was hungry and he told me he had barely eaten today so I decided to invite him to have lunch in Algemesí at La Bodegueta. “This all looks so delicious, I can’t decide what to eat.” he said. In the end we went for some typical food, we ate "Paella" and had a great conversation. When the waiter came around and realized that we were pilgrims, he told us about the typical festival in Algemesí. He mentioned the festival of San Sebastian de Villa, which celebrates the independence of Algemesí on the 20th of January. A civic procession is celebrated in the name of the people who achieved the independence. We were both interested and decided we wanted to go to the festival for one day <p></p>Then we both finished our delicious meals, waved the waiter goodbye and set off from the restaurant so that both of us could reach our destination after we had got out staves and sunglasses ready. Everyone was feeling equally cheerful and thrilled after that wonderful day. So we watched the sunset together and talked a lot.</p></div><span class="page-number">8</span>

<div class="titulo6"> <h3>James and the hidden fountain</h3> <p>James was walking to Xàtiva following the route of Saint James.</p> <p><img class="foto24" align="right" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1j_fA5tdJHt3T0R4NARMS7w23eXBLW_hH" alt="">When he arrived at the little church San Feliu, he saw a homeless beggar. He wore a torn vest covered in stains. This poor feller told him that if he gave him a coin, he would tell him a legend, a legend about the most beautiful woman in the world. James decided to do as he asked, passing him a coin from his pocket as his curiosity spiked from the thought of hearing about such interesting topic. This odd yet friendly beggar went onto narrating the legend in some more detail:</p> <p>“There are 1000 fountains under this church, however, one of these fountains is extremely special. The legend says if you drink from the right fountain, a beautiful woman with blond hair as shiny as gold shall appear before you, and she shall offer you three wishes of your choosing.”</p> <p>“Well if I do actually manage to find her, I'll just wish to marry her!", James said.</p> <p>After the beggar's story, suddenly he vanished into nothing, as if he was never there in the first place, leaving James with a mixture in his face of pure shock and uneasiness, as if he had just seen a ghost in the middle of the night</p> </div><span class="page-number">26</span>

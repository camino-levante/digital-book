        <div class="vb2">
         <p class="bb14">Today is the 13th May 1880. The top story of today's newspaper is a misunderstanding of another kind:</p><br>
         <p class="bb14">Marie-Constance Charpentier, a widow who inherited a large sum of money which she intended to spend wisely, wanted to invest in quality wine and oil. And which country is the most qualified for this type of request? Spain of course! She hired two couriers to buy the needed goods. Her plan was to buy the wine and oil for a cheap price and sell it with a large margin of profit in France. But God had other plans for this poor woman. When the couriers went back to present her their findings, she got a surprise that she didn’t expect. She intended to get ten arrobas of wine and oil from Valencia and Albacete but they were not equally heavy. How could this have happened? Did the couriers set her up? Or was her order not clear enough? The answer will surprise you!</p><br>
         <p class="bb14">Thanks to Napoleon France was introduced to a universal new way of measuring up different dimensions. This new system allows uniform measurement all over the country. But what has this to do with Carpentier's story?</p><br>
         <p class="bb14">Well, in Spain they do not have a system like this. Now some readers can imagine what is coming next. The Spanish have a local unit of measurements. In Albacete one arroba of wine is the equivalent of 6,365 liters and in Valencia one arroba of wine is the equivalent of 10,77 liters. Furthermore even one arroba of wine isn’t the same as one arroba of oil. Now I know what you are thinking. Why did she not know that? Well, that is because she is used to a unified system and she did not know how revolutionary it is.</p><br>
         <p class="bb14">Let’s hope that Spain will adopt this idea too. And let's celebrate Napoleon for once: he may have been in exile and addicted to power, but the introduction of the metric system was without question an idea that contributed greatly to the evolution of the human being.</p>

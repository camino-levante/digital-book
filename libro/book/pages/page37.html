<div class="titulo6"> <h3>Our friend’s journey</h3> <p>Last year Sandra and his friend Pedro set off from Valencia to go on a trip, because they wanted to get new experiences. They took a rucksack with toiletries, a lot of water, hiking clothes, two sleeping bags and more things to survive.</p> <p>In Valencia they lived in San Vicente Street which was Via Augusta in Roman times. It used to be the longest in Spain and is now part of the Santiago route. They felt delighted to be able to do this trip because they had planned it for a long time. </p> <p>They started the trip in Silla and wanted to arrive at the next stop in Benifaió . The journey would be about 15 km long. Along the way, they saw the Albufera lake, a very big lake full of reed and with beautiful colors, and the Penitentiary centre of Picasent. On the lake they took a little break and made a picknick with sandwiches and chocolate cookies. After eating, they jumped in the lake and wanted to swim, but the water was too cold so they decided to continue their way. When they finally arrived at night they went to a hotel called “Trip Valencia Almussafes” and had a traditional dinner - baked rice with beans - there.</p> </div><span class="page-number">37</span>

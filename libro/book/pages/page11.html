	<p>We arrived at a town. “Look. We’re there, deep talk girl.” He was right. We arrived at La Pobla Llarga. “Already? This only took us about three hours or so.”, I wondered. “I don’t mind, I’m dying of hunger” he laughed and I realized I felt hungry too. That’s why we took the first restaurant we spotted.</p>
	<p>The meals on the menu were simple, but we enjoyed it anyway.</p>
	<p>The day was almost over and we were tired, so we decided to go to bed early that day and looked forward to the next day.</p>
